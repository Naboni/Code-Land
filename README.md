# Code-Land
Code-Land is a platform for students who want to learn Data Structures and Algorithms.
It aims to eliminate the difficulties associated with understanding the concepts of data structures 
and algorithms. To make the topics easier to comprehend, it will also provide user-configurable 
graphic implementations of the majority of the algorithms and concepts (Recursion, Tree, and 
Graph).
Additionally, it will provide a selected set of questions on certain subjects to give students hands-on practice. There will be thorough descriptions on both the subject and answers to the 
questions. 
It will also have a code playground IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with almost 
every language support where students can easily test their code. It will also enable pairprogramming with other students on the same code, giving the ability to learn and solve 
together
